# taskParser.js

Parsing questionnaires to JS objects from human-readable markdown-like text files.

Intended for when you need to integrate questionnaires into a web application. ***Just use Qualtrics / MS forms / Google forms unless you really need something custom!***

## Source File Format

You can find an example task/questionnaire file [here](./exampletasks).

- `#` Marks the beginning of a **step**. Everything between this and the next `#` or `>` is considered the step title. The step title should include the string `task` or `questionnaire`. Note that how you render these is up to you.

```md
# Task 1

# Questionnaire 1

# Task 2: Instructions
```

- `>` Marks a **paragraph** (both **task** and **questionnaire** step) or a **question** (**questionnaire** step only)

```md
# Task 1

> This is the first paragraph of your task instructions.

> This is the second paragraph of your task instructions.

# Questionnaire 1

> This is a paragraph maybe shedding a bit more light on what the questionnaire is about. Alternatively, feel free to give additional instructions here!

> Were the instructions easy to understand?

...

> How many times did you re-read the instructions?

...

> Indicate your agreement with the following statement: I would like to try again in the future.

...

> (Optional) Provide general thoughts about the task.

...

```

- You can include images in both **task** and **questionnaire** steps. Just use the markdown syntax (e.g. `![](image.png)`), but make sure to precede this with the paragraph indicator (`>`)
    - Be aware that depending on how you render your frontend, the image file may need to be in a specific location. For example in Vite, images should be placed in the `public/` directory at the root of the repository.

```md
# Task 1

> This is an introduction to a task. Below this paragraph, you will see an image.

> ![](exampleimage.png)

> This is a second paragraph, maybe filling in some details regarding the image or the task instructions.
```

- `$` is used to indicate question parameters in **question**s. This can currently be `text`, `number`, `option` or `likert`.
    - **Question**s of `option` and `likert` type should include additional parameters separated by commas (`,`).
        - There can be as many options to an `option` question as you'd like.
        - `likert` parameters are: `minimum value, maximum value, minimum label, maximum label`

```md
# Questionnaire 1

> Were the instructions easy to understand?

$option, Yes, No

> How many times did you re-read the instructions?

$number

> Indicate your agreement with the following statement: I would like to try again in the future.

$likert, 1, 7, Strongly Disagree, Strongly Agree

> (Optional) Provide general thoughts about the task.

$text
```

Note that you can add line breaks, tabs and spaces as you see fit to make the file more readable to you. These are trimmed out when parsing the file.

## Usage

```js
import loadTasks from './taskParser.js'

const tasks = loadTasks()

console.log(tasks)
```

It's that easy!

Now you just need to code the part where everything is rendered ...and the data is collected ...and saved ðŸ˜„
